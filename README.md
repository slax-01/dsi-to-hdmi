LT8912

The Lontium LT8912 MIPI® DSI to LVDS and HDMI/MHL bridge features a single-channel MIPI® D-PHY receiver
front-end configuration with 4 data lanes per channel operating at 1.5Gbps per data lane and a maximum input
bandwidth of 6Gbps.
For screen application, the bridge decodes MIPI® DSI 18bpp RGB666 and 24bpp RGB888 packets and converts
the formatted video data stream to a compatible LVDS output operating at pixel clock operating from 25MHz to
154MHz, offering a single-link LVDS with 4 data lanes per link.
For TV application, the bridge provides a HDMI/MHL data output with optional S/PDIF or 2-channel I2S serial audio
input. Its high fidelity 2-channel I2S can transmit stereo up to a 192kHz sampling rate. The S/PDIF can carry stereo
LPCM audio or compressed audio, including Dolby® Digital and DTS®.
The LT8912 is fabricated in advanced CMOS process and implemented in both 12mm x 12mm LQFP at 0.5mm
pitch package and 7.5mm x 7.5mm QFN at 0.4mm pitch package. These packages are RoHS compliant and
specified to operate from −40°C to +85°C.
